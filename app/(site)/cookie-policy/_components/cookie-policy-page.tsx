          longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving
          customized settings like login information.

        <p>
          Some browsers have incorporated &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT)
          features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating
          you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common
          understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our website does not
          currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of
          other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including
          the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described
          above.
